//Extended a little further to allow ladder travel down, far far down.
//This place also looks a little... Off. On purpose. Just like the original. Weird mapping and structural design. Feels more like a 'front' than anything, especially with how deep
//	the ladder system goes... More difficult skeletons as compensation for the ability to go further down down down.
